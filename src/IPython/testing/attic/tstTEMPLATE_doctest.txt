Doctests for the ``XXX`` module
=====================================

The way doctest loads these, the entire document is applied as a single test
rather than multiple individual ones, unfortunately.


Auto-generated tests
--------------------

The tests below are generated from the companion file
test_toeplitz_doctest.py, which is run via IPython's irunner script to create
valid doctest input automatically.

# Setup - all imports are done in tcommon
>>> from IPython.testing.tcommon import *

# Rest of doctest goes here...


Manually generated tests
------------------------

These are one-off tests written by hand, copied from an interactive prompt.
